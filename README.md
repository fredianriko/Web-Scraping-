# Web-Scraping-
This repository contains code for scraping twitter using tweepy library and twitter API Developer key


requirement 

1. Tweepy
2. Python 3
3. Twitter Developer API Key

please considering to create Twitter Developer API first on : https://developer.twitter.com/en

you need to make an apps request first on that website, and you will get 4 keys which are:
- Consumer key
- Consumer Secret Key
- Accesss Token
- Access Token Secret

Remember to save both Access Token and Access Token Secret after you generate it. 

Next, if you already had API keys for Twitter, you should install Tweepy library, which you can read the documentation in here: https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#

Don't forget to check if you already had python 3 or not.

after all the requirement are sets. you can put all your 4 API keys inside the the ('') quotation mark.

consumer_key = ''
consumer_secret = ''
access_token = ''
access_token_secret = ''

If that done, you can open your terminal and run --> python test.py
you can change the file name as you like.
